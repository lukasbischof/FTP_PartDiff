\subsection{Centred Scheme}

Uses a forward difference in $t$ and a centred difference in $x$.

\subsubsection{Example using Advection Equation}


\textbf{Discretisation of Operators}

The discrete advection equation for the centred scheme is derived from the discretised equation:
\begin{align*}
	{\frac{\tilde{u}(x,t+\Delta t)-\tilde{u}(x,t)}{\Delta t}}+{\frac{\tilde{u}(x+\Delta x,t)-\tilde{u}(x-\Delta x,t)}{2\cdot\Delta x}}=0
\end{align*}

and has the iterative form (with $\utild_j^{(0)}=f_j$ on $\partial\Omega$):

\colorbox{shadecolor}{$
	\tilde{u}_{j}^{(k+1)}=-\frac{r}{2}\cdot\tilde{u}_{j+1}^{(k)}+\tilde{u}_{j}^{(k)}+\frac{r}{2}\cdot\tilde{u}_{j-1}^{(k)}
$}

Solution method is analogous to the upwind and downwind scheme,
just considering the left and right predecessor as well.
