\subsection{Maximum Principle for Elliptic Operators}
Theorem: If $L$ is an elliptic differential operator on a connected and bounded domain $\Omega$,
and $u$ is a solution $Lu = 0$, then $u$ takes its maximum and minimum on the boundary of $\Omega$.

\subsection{Uniqueness of Solutions}
Theorem: If $L$ is an elliptic differential operator on a connected and bounded domain $\Omega$,
then there is at most one solution of $Lu = f$ with boundary conditions $u_{|\partial\Omega} = g$.
